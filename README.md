Building deep neural networks with the help of PyToarch
# Dynamic graph generation, tight Python language integration, and a relatively simple API makes PyTorch an excellent platform for research and experimentation.

## Installation
PyTorch provides a very clean interface to get the right combination of tools to be installed. Below a snapshot to choose and the corresponding command. Stable represents the most currently tested and supported version of PyTorch. This should be suitable for many users. Preview is available if you want the latest version, not fully tested and supported. You can choose from Anaconda (recommended) and Pip installation packages and supporting various CUDA versions as well.

## PyTorch Modules
Now we will discuss key PyTorch Library modules like Tensors, Autograd, Optimizers and Neural Networks (NN ) which are essential to create and train neural networks.
